## Ordnance Library
The Ordnance Library is fed by two different SharePoint Online lists. These lists are split into ordnance items transferred outside of our organization and those that are retained within our building. This also helps alleviate the limitation of PowerApps maximum limit of 2000 rows.

## Home Page
Home page is broken into three different parts, Ordnance Library, New Item, and Transferred Ordnance items. It also displays the current available serial number.

### Features
**Ordnance Item Lookup**: Allows a user to find an ordnance item within our building. It can be searched by it's nomenclature, serial number, or location. Each of our shelves are labeled so that items on specific shelves can be found. This is vital for inspection as the inspector will select a shelf and pick several items and inspect the documentation.

**Modify Details**: Users can upload photos into the PowerApp that are then posted into SharePoint and serve as the thumbnail. If a user is looking via SharePoint online instead of needing to memorize each item by it's nomenclature a thumbnail will greatly help in finding the item.

**Generate Inert Certification**: The biggest time drain in adding an ordnance item is completing the inert certification paperwork. This requires multiple fields and two signatures. The application will generate an inert cert that is printed and can be wet signed or with a digital signature.

**Research Resources**: To quickly put resources on hand with team leaders, the most commonly used resources are hyperlinked within the app for ease of access.
