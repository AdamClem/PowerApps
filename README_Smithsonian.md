## Smithsonian PowerApp
There are two main problems that are addressed using this app.
  1. Smithsonian data - generally dirty, unstructured, and incorrect (in terms of expert technicians)
  2. Updating technical data - highly technical, regimented, sometimes controlled information

## Home Page
The home page has links to each physical locations. Specialized teams are sent to Smithsonian locations for a review of thier off-exhibit items. Each item is visually inspected, researched, photographed, and x-ray'ed. Once complete, the team will place this technical data into the app and it will then upload the information to the flat excel files that are shared between our military unit and the Smithsonian.

### Features
**Item Lookup**: Users can search through the Smithsonian information to find the correct ordnance item that they need. The serial numbers assigned by the Smithsonian are mixed data sources as strings and integers. To alleviate this mis-match, when searching through the search bar, the inputs are cast as text.

**Update Tech Details**: Specific explosive ordnance data is updated for further research and submission to headquarters elements for ingestion into publication system.

**Manage Adjacent Teams**: Teams that assist the Smithsonian come from across the Marine Corps (Camp Lejeune NC, Camp Pendleton CA, Yuma Air Station AZ, Camp Foster Japan)
